Look for where name bases and the dict come from in this example class definition. \"Lets define a metaclass that will demonstrate how class: calls it.\" And now an example that actually means something this will automatically make the variables in the list \"attributes\" set on the class and set to None. \"Note that the magic behaviour that Initalised gains by having the metaclass init_attributes is not passed onto a subclass of Initalised.\" \"Here is an even more concrete example showing how you can subclass type to make a metaclass that performs an action when the class is created.\" This is quite tricky:',\n",
              "  'I think the ONLamp introduction to metaclass programming is well written and gives a really good introduction to the topic despite being several years old already. http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2003/04/17/metaclasses.html (archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20080206005253/http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2003/04/17/metaclasses.html) In short: A class is a blueprint for the creation of an instance a metaclass is a blueprint for the creation of a class. It can be easily seen that in Python classes need to be first-class objects too to enable this behavior. \"Ive never written one myself but I think one of the nicest uses of metaclasses can be seen in the Django framework.\" The model classes use a metaclass approach to enable a declarative style of writing new models or form classes. While the metaclass is creating the class all members get the possibility to customize the class itself. Creating a new model The metaclass enabling this \"The thing thats left to say is: If you dont know what metaclasses are the probability that you will not need them is 99%.\"',\n",
              "  'One use for metaclasses is adding new properties and methods to an instance automatically. For example if you look at Django models their definition looks a bit confusing. It looks as if you are only defining class properties: However at runtime the Person objects are filled with all sorts of useful methods. See the source for some amazing metaclassery.',\n",
              "  'A metaclass is the class of a class. Like a class defines how an instance of the class behaves a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass. While in Python you can use arbitrary callables for metaclasses (like Jerub shows) the more useful approach is actually to make it an actual class itself. type is the usual metaclass in Python. \"In case youre wondering yes type is itself a class and it is its own type.\" \"You wont be able to recreate something like type purely in Python but Python cheats a little.\" To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass type. A metaclass is most commonly used as a class-factory. \"Like you create an instance of the class by calling the class Python creates a new class (when it executes the class statement) by calling the metaclass.\" \"Combined with the normal __init__ and __new__ methods metaclasses therefore allow you to do extra things when creating a class like registering the new class with some registry or even replace the class with something else entirely.\" When the class statement is executed Python first executes the body of the class statement as a normal block of code. The resulting namespace (a dict) holds the attributes of the class-to-be. The metaclass is determined by looking at the baseclasses of the class-to-be (metaclasses are inherited) at the __metaclass__ attribute of the class-to-be (if any) or the __metaclass__ global variable. The metaclass is then called with the name bases and attributes of the class to instantiate it. However metaclasses actually define the type of a class not just a factory for it so you can do much more with them. You can for instance define normal methods on the metaclass. These metaclass-methods are like classmethods in that they can be called on the class without an instance but they are also not like classmethods in that they cannot be called on an instance of the class. type.__subclasses__() is an example of a method on the type metaclass. \"You can also define the normal magic methods like __add__ __iter__ and __getattr__ to implement or change how the class behaves.\" \"Heres an aggregated example of the bits and pieces:\"',\n",

Just so you know you can specify \"C\" linkage to each individual declaration/definition explicitly or use a block to group a sequence of declarations/definitions to have a certain linkage: If you care about the technicalities they are listed in section 7.5 of the C++03 standard here is a brief summary (with emphasis on extern \"C\"): extern \"C\" is a linkage-specification Every compiler is required to provide \"C\" linkage a linkage specification shall occur only in namespace scope \" all function types function names and variable names have a language linkage  See Richards Comment: Only function names and variable names with external linkage have a language linkage\" two function types with distinct language linkages are distinct types even if otherwise identical linkage specs nest inner one determines the final linkage extern \"C\" is ignored for class members at most one function with a particular name can have \"C\" linkage (regardless of namespace)  extern \"C\" forces a function to have external linkage (cannot make it static)   See Richard\\\\s comment:    \\\\static\\\\ inside \\\\extern \"C\"\\\\ is valid; an entity so declared has internal linkage and so does not have a language linkage Linkage from C++ to objects defined in other languages and to objects defined in C++ from other languages is implementation-defined and language-dependent. Only where the object layout strategies of two language implementations are similar enough can such linkage be achieved',\n",

In C the symbol name is the same as the function name. This is possible because in C no two non-static functions can have the same name. Because C++ allows overloading and has many features that C does not — like classes member functions exception specifications - it is not possible to simply use the function name as the symbol name. To solve that C++ uses so-called name mangling which transforms the function name and all the necessary information (like the number and size of the arguments) into some weird-looking string processed only by the compiler and linker. \"So if you specify a function to be extern C the compiler doesnt performs name mangling with it and it can be directly accessed using its symbol name as the function name.\" This comes handy while using dlsym() and dlopen() for calling such functions.',\n",

This has the benefit of rapid scan / retrieval of records falling into some range of clustered index values. For example you have two tables Customer and Order: If you wish to quickly retrieve all orders of one particular customer you may wish to create a clustered index on the \"CustomerID\" column of the Order table. This way the records with the same CustomerID will be physically stored close to each other on disk (clustered) which speeds up their retrieval. P.S. The index on CustomerID will obviously be not unique so you either need to add a second field to \"uniquify\" the index or let the database handle that for you but that\\\\s another story. Regarding multiple indexes. You can have only one clustered index per table because this defines how the data is physically arranged. If you wish an analogy imagine a big room with many tables in it. You can either put these tables to form several rows or pull them all together to form a big conference table but not both ways at the same time.

Almost all low-level graphics routines use bitshifting. For example way back in the olden days we used mode 13h (320x200 256 colors) for games. In Mode 13h the video memory was laid out sequentially per pixel. That meant to calculate the location for a pixel you would use the following math: Now back in that day and age speed was critical so we would use bitshifts to do this operation. However 320 is not a power of two so to get around this we have to find out what is a power of two that added together makes 320: Now we can convert that into left shifts: For a final result of: \"Now we get the same offset as before except instead of an expensive multiplication operation we use the two bitshifts...in x86 it would be something like this (note its been forever since Ive done assembly (editors note: corrected a couple mistakes and added a 32-bit example)):\" Total: 28 cycles on whatever ancient CPU had these timings. Vrs 12 cycles on the same ancient CPU. Yes we would work this hard to shave off 16 CPU cycles. In 32 or 64-bit mode both versions get a lot shorter and faster. Modern out-of-order execution CPUs like Intel Skylake (see http://agner.org/optimize/) have very fast hardware multiply (low latency and high throughput) so the gain is much smaller. AMD Bulldozer-family is a bit slower especially for 64-bit multiply. On Intel CPUs and AMD Ryzen two shifts are slightly lower latency but more instructions than a multiply (which may lead to lower throughput): vs. Compilers will do this for you: See how gcc clang and MSVC all use shift+lea when optimizing return 320*row + col;. The most interesting thing to note here is that x86 has a shift-and-add instruction (LEA) that can do small left shifts and add at the same time with the performance as and add instruction. ARM is even more powerful: one operand of any instruction can be left or right shifted for free. \"So scaling by a compile-time-constant thats known to be a power-of-2 can be even more efficient than a multiply.\" OK back in the modern days... something more useful now would be to use bitshifting to store two 8-bit values in a 16-bit integer.

              "  'The bit shifting operators do exactly what their name implies. They shift bits. \"Heres a brief (or not-so-brief) introduction to the different shift operators.\" The Operators &gt;&gt; is the  arithmetic (or signed) right shift operator. &gt;&gt;&gt; is the logical (or unsigned) right shift operator. &lt;&lt; is the left shift operator and meets the needs of both logical and arithmetic shifts. All of these operators can be applied to integer values (int long possibly short and byte or char). In some languages applying the shift operators to any datatype smaller than int automatically resizes the operand to be an int. Note that &lt;&lt;&lt; is not an operator because it would be redundant. Also note that C and C++ do not distinguish between the right shift operators. They provide only the &gt;&gt; operator and the right-shifting behavior is implementation defined for signed types. Left shift (&lt;&lt;) Integers are stored in memory as a series of bits. For example the number 6 stored as a 32-bit int would be: Shifting this bit pattern to the left one position (6 &lt;&lt; 1) would result in the number 12: As you can see the digits have shifted to the left by one position and the last digit on the right is filled with a zero. You might also note that shifting left is equivalent to multiplication by powers of 2. So 6 &lt;&lt; 1 is equivalent to 6 * 2 and 6 &lt;&lt; 3 is equivalent to 6 * 8. A good optimizing compiler will replace multiplications with shifts when possible. Non-circular shifting Please note that these are not circular shifts. Shifting this value to the left by one position (3758096384 &lt;&lt; 1): results in 3221225472: The digit that gets shifted \"off the end\" is lost. It does not wrap around. Logical right shift (>>>) A logical right shift is the converse to the left shift. Rather than moving bits to the left they simply move to the right. For example shifting the number 12: to the right by one position (12 &gt;&gt;&gt; 1) will get back our original 6: So we see that shifting to the right is equivalent to division by powers of 2. Lost bits are gone However a shift cannot reclaim \"lost\" bits. For example if we shift this pattern: to the left 4 positions (939524102 &lt;&lt; 4) we get 2147483744: and then shifting back ((939524102 &lt;&lt; 4) &gt;&gt;&gt; 4) we get 134217734: We cannot get back our original value once we have lost bits. Arithmetic right shift (>>) The arithmetic right shift is exactly like the logical right shift except instead of padding with zero it pads with the most significant bit. This is because the most significant bit is the sign bit or the bit that distinguishes positive and negative numbers. By padding with the most significant bit the arithmetic right shift is sign-preserving. For example if we interpret this bit pattern as a negative number: we have the number -2147483552. Shifting this to the right 4 positions with the arithmetic shift (-2147483552 >> 4) would give us: or the number -134217722. So we see that we have preserved the sign of our negative numbers by using the arithmetic right shift rather than the logical right shift. And once again we see that we are performing division by powers of 2.',\n",
              "  'Bitwise operations including bit shift are fundamental to low-level hardware or embedded programming. If you read a specification for a device or even some binary file formats you will see bytes words and dwords broken up into non-byte aligned bitfields which contain various values of interest. Accessing these bit-fields for reading/writing is the most common usage. A simple real example in graphics programming is that a 16-bit pixel is represented as follows: To get at the green value you would do this: Explanation In order to obtain the value of green ONLY which starts at offset 5 and ends at 10 (i.e. 6-bits long) you need to use a (bit) mask which when applied against the entire 16-bit pixel will yield only the bits we are interested in. The appropriate mask is 0x7E0 which in binary is 0000011111100000 (which is 2016 in decimal). To apply a mask you use the AND operator (&amp;). \"After applying the mask youll end up with a 16-bit number which is really just a 11-bit number since its MSB is in the 11th bit.\" Green is actually only 6-bits long so we need to scale it down using a right shift (11 - 6 = 5) hence the use of 5 as offset (#define GREEN_OFFSET  5).

Static Variables (i.e. static $db_connection) can be shared among all instances of a type of object. For example all database objects share a single connection (static $connection). Static Variables Example:Pretend we have a database class with a single member variable: static $num_connections;Now put this in the constructor: Just as objects have constructors they also have destructors which are executed when the object dies or is unset: Every time we create a new instance it will increase our connection counter by one. Every time we destroy or stop using an instance it will decrease the connection counter by one. In this way we can monitor the number of instances of the database object we have in use with: Because $num_connections is static (shared) it will reflect the total number of active database objects.

Normally in Python you want your code to support inheritance of course (since inheritance is so handy it would be bad to stop code using yours from using it! ) so isinstance is less bad than checking identity of types because it seamlessly supports inheritance. \"Its not that isinstance is good mind you—its just less bad than checking equality of types.\" The normal Pythonic preferred solution is almost invariably \"duck typing\": try using the argument as if it was of a certain desired type do it in a try/except statement catching all exceptions that could arise if the argument was not in fact of that type (or any other type nicely duck-mimicking it;-) and in the except clause try something else (using the argument \"as if\" it was of some other type). basestring is however quite a special case—a builtin type that exists only to let you use isinstance (both str and unicode subclass basestring). Strings are sequences (you could loop over them index them slice them ...) but you generally want to treat them as \"scalar\" types—it\\\\s somewhat incovenient (but a reasonably frequent use case) to treat all kinds of strings (and maybe other scalar types i.e. ones you can\\\\t loop on) one way all containers (lists sets dicts ...) in another way and basestring plus isinstance helps you do that—the overall structure of this idiom is something like: You could say that basestring is an Abstract Base Class (\"ABC\")—it offers no concrete functionality to subclasses but rather exists as a \"marker\" mainly for use with isinstance. The concept is obviously a growing one in Python since PEP 3119 which introduces a generalization of it was accepted and has been implemented starting with Python 2.6 and 3.0. The PEP makes it clear that while ABCs can often substitute for duck typing there is generally no big pressure to do that (see here). ABCs as implemented in recent Python versions do however offer extra goodies: isinstance (and issubclass) can now mean more than just \"[an instance of] a derived class\" (in particular any class can be \"registered\" with an ABC so that it will show as a subclass and its instances as instances of the ABC); and ABCs can also offer extra convenience to actual subclasses in a very natural way via Template Method design pattern applications (see here and here [[part II]] for more on the TM DP in general and specifically in Python independent of ABCs).

Being \"owned\" by a object/class means that you refer to the method through the object/class; for example in Java if you want to invoke a method \"open()\" owned by an object \"door\" you need to write \"door.open()\". Usually methods also gain some extra attributes describing their behaviour within the object/class for example: visibility (related to the object oriented concept of encapsulation) which defines from which objects (or classes) the method can be invoked.

In my experience this crops up more often in hashCode() and equals(). \"If youre dealing with an ORM make sure to always use getters and never field references in hashCode() and equals().\" Saving an object will change its state Persistent objects often use a id field to hold the key of the object. This field will be automatically updated when an object is first saved. \"Dont use an id field in hashCode().\" But you can use it in equals().

One reason for this is that GET may be used arbitrarily by robots or crawlers which should not need to consider the side effects that a request should cause. and POST submits data to be processed (e.g. from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new resource or the updates of existing resources or both. So essentially GET is used to retrieve remote data and POST is used to insert/update remote data. HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616) section 9 Method Definitions contains more information on GET and POST as well as the other HTTP methods if you are interested. In addition to explaining the intended uses of each method the spec also provides at least one practical reason for why GET should only be used to retrieve data: Authors of services which use the HTTP protocol SHOULD NOT use GET based forms for the submission of sensitive data because this will cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI. Many existing servers proxies and user agents will log the request URI in some place where it might be visible to third parties. Servers can use POST-based form submission instead Finally an important consideration when using GET for AJAX requests is that some browsers - IE in particular - will cache the results of a GET request.

As for light-weight branches then Mercurial has supported repositories with multiple branches since... always I think. Git repositories with multiple branches are exactly that: multiple diverged strands of development in a single repository. Git then adds names to these strands and allow you to query these names remotely. The Bookmarks extension for Mercurial adds local names and with Mercurial 1.6 you can move these bookmarks around when you push/pull..

In Mercurial we do: Notice how the Mercurial commands are plain and not special at all -- the only unusual thing is the --force flag to hg pull which is needed since Mercurial will abort otherwise when you pull from an unrelated repository.

This may introduce a few bugs and unexpected behaviors. But you are not required to write a main() function and call it inside an if statement. I myself usually start writing small throwaway scripts without any kind of function. If the script grows big enough or if I feel putting all that code inside a function will benefit me then I refactor the code and do it. This also happens when I write bash scripts.

A neat variation could be: This means you can call main() from other scripts (or interactive shell) passing custom parameters. This might be useful in unit tests or when batch-processing.

              "  'Quick note this is almost certainly confusing Big O notation (which is an upper bound) with Theta notation (which is a two-side bound). In my experience this is actually typical of discussions in non-academic settings. Apologies for any confusion caused. Big O complexity can be visualized with this graph: The simplest definition I can give for Big-O notation is this: Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm. There are some important and deliberately chosen words in that sentence: relative: you can only compare apples to apples. \"You cant compare an algorithm to do arithmetic multiplication to an algorithm that sorts a list of integers.\" But a comparison of two algorithms to do arithmetic operations (one multiplication one addition) will tell you something meaningful; representation: Big-O (in its simplest form) reduces the comparison between algorithms to a single variable. That variable is chosen based on observations or assumptions. For example sorting algorithms are typically compared based on comparison operations (comparing two nodes to determine their relative ordering). This assumes that comparison is expensive. But what if comparison is cheap but swapping is expensive? It changes the comparison; and complexity: if it takes me one second to sort 10000 elements how long will it take me to sort one million? Complexity in this instance is a relative measure to something else. \"Come back and reread the above when youve read the rest.\" The best example of Big-O I can think of is doing arithmetic. Take two numbers (123456 and 789012). The basic arithmetic operations we learnt in school were: addition; subtraction; multiplication; and division. Each of these is an operation or a problem. A method of solving these is called an algorithm. Addition is the simplest. You line the numbers up (to the right) and add the digits in a column writing the last number of that addition in the result. \"The tens part of that number is carried over to the next column.\" \"Lets assume that the addition of these numbers is the most expensive operation in this algorithm.\" It stands to reason that to add these two numbers together we have to add together 6 digits (and possibly carry a 7th). If we add two 100 digit numbers together we have to do 100 additions. If we add two 10000 digit numbers we have to do 10000 additions. See the pattern? The complexity (being the number of operations) is directly proportional to the number of digits n in the larger number. We call this O(n) or linear complexity. Subtraction is similar (except you may need to borrow instead of carry). Multiplication is different. You line the numbers up take the first digit in the bottom number and multiply it in turn against each digit in the top number and so on through each digit. So to multiply our two 6 digit numbers we must do 36 multiplications. We may need to do as many as 10 or 11 column adds to get the end result too. If we have two 100-digit numbers we need to do 10000 multiplications and 200 adds. For two one million digit numbers we need to do one trillion (1012) multiplications and two million adds. As the algorithm scales with n-squared this is O(n2) or quadratic complexity. This is a good time to introduce another important concept: We only care about the most significant portion of complexity. The astute may have realized that we could express the number of operations as: n2 + 2n. But as you saw from our example with two numbers of a million digits apiece the second term (2n) becomes insignificant (accounting for 0.0002% of the total operations by that stage). \"One can notice that weve assumed the worst case scenario here.\" While multiplying 6 digit numbers if one of them is 4 digit and the other one is 6 digit then we only have 24 multiplications. \"Still we calculate the worst case scenario for that n i.e when both are 6 digit numbers.\" Hence Big-O notation is about the Worst-case scenario of an algorithm The Telephone Book \"The next best example I can think of is the telephone book normally called the White Pages or similar but itll vary from country to country.\" \"But Im talking about the one that lists people by surname and then initials or first name possibly address and then telephone numbers.\" Now if you were instructing a computer to look up the phone number for \"John Smith\" in a telephone book that contains 1000000 names what would you do? \"Ignoring the fact that you could guess how far in the Ss started (lets assume you cant) what would you do?\" A typical implementation might be to open up to the middle take the 500000th and compare it to \"Smith\". If it happens to be \"Smith John\" we just got real lucky. Far more likely is that \"John Smith\" will be before or after that name. \"If its after we then divide the last half of the phone book in half and repeat.\" \"If its before then we divide the first half of the phone book in half and repeat.\" And so on. This is called a binary search and is used every day in programming whether you realize it or not. So if you want to find a name in a phone book of a million names you can actually find any name by doing this at most 20 times. \"In comparing search algorithms we decide that this comparison is our n.\" For a phone book of 3 names it takes 2 comparisons (at most). For 7 it takes at most 3. For 15 it takes 4. … For 1000000 it takes 20. \"That is staggeringly good isnt it?\" In Big-O terms this is O(log n) or logarithmic complexity. Now the logarithm in question could be ln (base e) log10 log2 or some other base. \"It doesnt matter its still O(log n) just like O(2n2) and O(100n2) are still both O(n2).\" \"Its worthwhile at this point to explain that Big O can be used to determine three cases with an algorithm:\" Best Case: In the telephone book search the best case is that we find the name in one comparison. This is O(1) or constant complexity; Expected Case: As discussed above this is O(log n); and Worst Case: This is also O(log n). \"Normally we dont care about the best case.\" \"Were interested in the expected and worst case.\" Sometimes one or the other of these will be more important. Back to the telephone book. What if you have a phone number and want to find a name? The police have a reverse phone book but such look-ups are denied to the general public. Or are they? Technically you can reverse look-up a number in an ordinary phone book. How? You start at the first name and compare the number. \"If its a match great if not you move on to the next.\" You have to do it this way because the phone book is unordered (by phone number anyway). So to find a name given the phone number (reverse lookup): Best Case: O(1); Expected Case: O(n) (for 500000); and Worst Case: O(n) (for 1000000). The Travelling Salesman This is quite a famous problem in computer science and deserves a mention. In this problem you have N towns. Each of those towns is linked to 1 or more other towns by a road of a certain distance. The Travelling Salesman problem is to find the shortest tour that visits every town. Sounds simple? Think again. If you have 3 towns A B and C with roads between all pairs then you could go: A → B → C A → C → B B → C → A B → A → C C → A → B C → B → A \"Well actually theres less than that because some of these are equivalent (A → B → C and C → B → A are equivalent for example because they use the same roads just in reverse).\" In actuality there are 3 possibilities. Take this to 4 towns and you have (iirc) 12 possibilities. \"With 5 its 60.\" 6 becomes 360. This is a function of a mathematical operation called a factorial. Basically: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720 7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040 … 25! = 25 × 24 × … × 2 × 1 = 15511210043330985984000000 … 50! = 50 × 49 × … × 2 × 1 = 3.04140932 × 1064 So the Big-O of the Travelling Salesman problem is O(n! ) or factorial or combinatorial complexity. \"By the time you get to 200 towns there isnt enough time left in the universe to solve the problem with traditional computers.\" Something to think about. Polynomial Time Another point I wanted to make quick mention of is that any algorithm that has a complexity of O(na) is said to have polynomial complexity or is solvable in polynomial time. O(n) O(n2) etc are all polynomial time. Some problems cannot be solved in polynomial time. Certain things are used in the world because of this. Public Key Cryptography is a prime example. It is computationally hard to find two prime factors of a very large number. \"If it wasnt we couldnt use the public key systems we use.\" \"Anyway thats it for my (hopefully plain English) explanation of Big O (revised).\"',\n",

A steam engine may be faster than a toy rocket but no steam piston engine will be able to achieve the speeds of an orbital launch vehicle. This is because these systems have different scaling characteristics with regards to the relation of fuel required (\"resource usage\") to reach a given speed (\"input size\"). Why is this so important? Because software deals with problems that may differ in size by factors up to a trillion. Consider that for a moment. The ratio between the speed necessary to travel to the Moon and human walking speed is less than 10000:1 and that is absolutely tiny compared to the range in input sizes software may face. \"And because software may face an astronomical range in input sizes there is the potential for the Big O complexity of an algorithm its fundamental scaling nature to trump any implementation details.\" Consider the canonical sorting example. Bubble-sort is O(n2) while merge-sort is O(n log n). \"Lets say you have two sorting applications application A which uses bubble-sort and application B which uses merge-sort and lets say that for input sizes of around 30 elements application A is 1000x faster than application B at sorting.\" \"If you never have to sort much more than 30 elements then its obvious that you should prefer application A as it is much faster at these input sizes.\" \"However if you find that you may have to sort ten million items then what youd expect is that application B actually ends up being thousands of times faster than application A in this case entirely due to the way each algorithm scales.\"',\n",

The n is the number of elements in the the problem (i.e size of an array number of nodes in a tree etc.) We are interested in describing the running time as n gets  big. When we say some algorithm is O(f(n)) we are saying that the running time (or space required) by that algorithm is always lower than some constant times f(n). To say that binary search has a running time of O(logn) is to say that there exists some constant c which you can multiply log(n) by that will always be larger than the running time of binary search. In this case you will always have some constant factor of log(n) comparisons. In other words where g(n) is the running time of your algorithm we say that g(n) = O(f(n)) when g(n) &lt;= c*f(n) when n > k where c and k are some constants.',\n",

Every time Charset.defaultCharset() is called it returns the cached charset. Here are my results: \"Im using JVM 1.6 though.\" (update) Ok. I did reproduce your bug with JVM 1.5. \"Looking at the source code of 1.5 the cached default charset isnt being set.\" \"I dont know if this is a bug or not but 1.6 changes this implementation and uses the cached charset:\" JVM 1.5: JVM 1.6: \"When you set the file encoding to file.encoding=Latin-1 the next time you call Charset.defaultCharset() what happens is because the cached default charset isnt set it will try to find the appropriate charset for the name Latin-1.\" \"This name isnt found because its incorrect and returns the default UTF-8.\" As for why the IO classes such as OutputStreamWriter return an unexpected result the implementation of sun.nio.cs.StreamEncoder (witch is used by these IO classes) is different as well for JVM 1.5 and JVM 1.6. The JVM 1.6 implementation is based in the Charset.defaultCharset() method to get the default encoding if one is not provided to IO classes. The JVM 1.5 implementation uses a different method Converters.getDefaultEncodingName(); to get the default charset. \"This method uses its own cache of the default charset that is set upon JVM initialization:\" JVM 1.6: JVM 1.5: But I agree with the comments. \"You shouldnt rely on this property.\" \"Its an implementation detail.\"',\n",

See http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/intl/encoding.doc.html When you do that looks like Charset resets to UTF-8 from looking at the source. That at least explains most of the behavior. \"I dont know why OutputStreamWriter shows ISO8859_1.\" It delegates to closed-source sun.misc. * classes. \"Im guessing it isnt quite dealing with encoding via the same mechanism which is weird.\" But of course you should always be specifying what encoding you mean in this code. \"Id never rely on the platform default.\"',\n",

The OutputStreamWriter is however caching the default character set and is probably used already during VM initialization so that its default character set diverts from Charset.defaultCharset() if the system property \"file.encoding\" has been changed at runtime. As already pointed out it is not documented how the VM must behave in such a situation. The Charset.defaultCharset() API documentation is not very precise on how the default character set is determined only mentioning that it is usually done on VM startup based on factors like the OS default character set or default locale.',\n",

For example you may have fields that are derived from other fields and should only be done so programmatically rather than having the state be persisted via serialization. \"Heres a GalleryImage class which contains an image and a thumbnail derived from the image:\" In this example the thumbnailImage is a thumbnail image that is generated by invoking the generateThumbnail method. The thumbnailImage field is marked as transient so only the original image is serialized rather than persisting both the original image and the thumbnail image. This means that less storage would be needed to save the serialized object. (Of course this may or may not be desirable depending on the requirements of the system -- this is just an example.) At the time of deserialization the readObject method is called to perform any operations necessary to restore the state of the object back to the state at which the serialization occurred. Here the thumbnail needs to be generated so the readObject method is overridden so that the thumbnail will be generated by calling the generateThumbnail method.

If the select statement used by the view joins many tables or uses joins based on non-indexed columns the view could perform poorly. Materialized views are similar to regular views in that they are a logical view of your data (based on a select statement) however the underlying query resultset has been saved to a table. The upside of this is that when you query a materialized view you are querying a table which may also be indexed. In addition because all the joins have been resolved at materialized view refresh time you pay the price of the join once (or as often as you refresh your materialized view) rather than each time you select from the materialized view. In addition with query rewrite enabled Oracle can optimize a query that selects from the source of your materialized view in such a way that it instead reads from your materialized view. In situations where you create materialized views as forms of aggregate tables or as copies of frequently executed queries this can greatly speed up the response time of your end user application. The downside though is that the data you get back from the materialized view is only as up to date as the last time the materialized view has been refreshed.

Materialized views can be incrementally updated by combining them with materialized view logs which act as change data capture sources on the underlying tables.

App Server can also serve HTTP Content but is not limited to just HTTP. It can be provided other protocol support such as RMI/RPC Web Server is mostly designed to serve static content though most Web Servers have plugins to support scripting languages like Perl PHP ASP JSP etc. through which these servers can generate dynamic HTTP content. Most of the application servers have Web Server as integral part of them that means App Server can do whatever Web Server is capable of. Additionally App Server have components and features to support Application level services such as Connection Pooling Object Pooling Transaction Support Messaging services etc. As web servers are well suited for static content and app servers for dynamic content most of the production environments have web server acting as reverse proxy to app server. That means while servicing a page request static contents (such as images/Static HTML) are served by web server that interprets the request. Using some kind of filtering technique (mostly extension of requested resource) web server identifies dynamic content request and transparently forwards to app server Example of such configuration is Apache Tomcat HTTP Server and Oracle (formerly BEA) WebLogic Server. Apache Tomcat HTTP Server is Web Server and Oracle WebLogic is Application Server. In some cases the servers are tightly integrated such as IIS and .NET Runtime. IIS is web server.

Some history. In early days of the Mosaic browser and hyperlinked content there evolved this thing called a \"web server\" that served web page content and images over HTTP. Most of the content was static and the HTTP 1.0 protocol was just a way to ship files around. Quickly the \"web server\" category evolved to include CGI capability - effectively launching a process on each web request to generate dynamic content. HTTP also matured and the products became more sophisticated with caching security and management features. As the technology matured we got company-specific Java-based server-side technology from Kiva and NetDynamics which eventually all merged into JSP. Microsoft added ASP I think in 1996 to Windows NT 4.0. The static web server had learned some new tricks so that it was an effective \"app server\" for many scenarios. In a parallel category the app server had evolved and existed for a long time. companies delivered products for Unix like Tuxedo TopEnd Encina that were philosophically derived from Mainframe application management and monitoring environments like IMS and CICS. \"Microsofts offering was Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) which later evolved into COM+.\" Most of these products specified \"closed\" product-specific communications protocols to interconnect \"fat\" clients to servers. (For Encina the comms protocol was DCE RPC; for MTS it was DCOM; etc.) In 1995/96 these traditional app server products began to embed basic HTTP communication capability at first via gateways. And the lines began to blur. Web servers got more and more mature with respect to handling higher loads more concurrency and better features. App servers delivered more and more HTTP-based communication capability. At this point the line between \"app server\" and \"web server\" is a fuzzy one. But people continue to use the terms differently as a matter of emphasis. When someone says \"web server\" you often think HTTP-centric web UI oriented apps. When someone says \"App server\" you may think \"heavier loads enterprise features transactions and queuing multi-channel communication (HTTP + more). But often it is the same product that serves both sets of workload requirements. WebSphere IBM\\\\s \"app server\" has its own bundled web server. WebLogic another traditional app server likewise. \"Windows which is Microsofts App Server (in addition to being its File&amp;Print Server Media Server etc.\" ) bundles IIS.',\n",

This also works for interfaces enums any-dimensional arrays (e.g. String[].class) primitives (e.g. int.class) and the keyword void (i.e. void.class). Class itself is generic (declared as Class&lt;T&gt; where T stands for the type that the Class object is representing) meaning that the type of String.class is Class&lt;String&gt;. \"So whenever you call the constructor for GenSet you pass in a class literal for the first argument representing an array of the GenSet instances declared type (e.g.\" String[].class for GenSet&lt;String&gt;). \"Note that you wont be able to get an array of primitives since primitives cant be used for type variables.\" Inside the constructor calling the method cast returns the passed Object argument cast to the class represented by the Class object on which the method was called. Calling the static method newInstance in java.lang.reflect.Array returns as an Object an array of the type represented by the Class object passed as the first argument and of the length specified by the int passed as the second argument. Calling the method getComponentType returns a Class object representing the component type of the array represented by the Class object on which the method was called (e.g. \"String.class for String[].class null if the Class object doesnt represent an array).\" \"That last sentence isnt entirely accurate.\" \"Calling String[].class.getComponentType() returns a Class object representing the class String but its type is Class&lt;?&gt; not Class&lt;String&gt; which is why you cant do something like the following.\" Same goes for every method in Class that returns a Class object. \"Regarding Joachim Sauers comment on this answer (I dont have enough reputation to comment on it myself) the example using the cast to T[] will result in a warning because the compiler cant guarantee type safety in that case.\" \"Edit regarding Ingos comments:\"',\n",

This strategy is most applicable to high-volume systems and three-tier architectures where you do not necessarily maintain a connection to the database for your session. In this situation the client cannot actually maintain database locks as the connections are taken from a pool and you may not be using the same connection from one access to the next. Pessimistic Locking is when you lock the record for your exclusive use until you have finished with it. It has much better integrity than optimistic locking but requires you to be careful with your application design to avoid Deadlocks. To use pessimistic locking you need either a direct connection to the database (as would typically be the case in a two tier client server application) or an externally available transaction ID that can be used independently of the connection. In the latter case you open the transaction with the TxID and then reconnect using that ID. The DBMS maintains the locks and allows you to pick the session back up through the TxID.

It wrote the data out in sorted form: BIGBLOCK so that when reading it back in ended up with the following tree: BIGBLOCK which is the degenerate form. \"If you go looking for Frank in that tree youll have to search all six nodes before you find him.\" Binary trees become truly useful when you balance them. This involves rotating sub-trees through their root node so that the height difference between any two sub-trees is less than or equal to 1. Adding those names above one at a time into a balanced tree would give you the following sequence: BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK You can actually see whole sub-trees rotating to the left as the entries are added and this gives you a balanced binary tree in which the worst case lookup is O(log N) rather than O(N) as the degenerate form gives. At no point does the highest NULL (=) differ from the lowest by more than one level. And in the final tree above you can find Frank by only looking at three nodes (Chloe Edwina and finally Frank). Of course they become even more useful when you make them balanced multi-way trees rather than binary tress. That means that each node holds more than one item (technically they hold N items and N+1 pointers a binary tree being a special case of a 1-way multi-way tree  with 1 item and 2 pointers). With a three-way tree you end up with: BIGBLOCK This is typically used in maintaining keys for an index of items. \"Ive written database software optimised for the hardware where a node is exactly the size of a disk block (say 512 bytes) and you put as many keys as you can into a single node.\" The pointers in this case were actually record numbers into a fixed-length-record direct-access file separate from the index file (so record number X could be found by just seeking to X * record_length). For example if the pointers are 4 bytes and the key size is 10 the number of keys in a 512-byte node is 36. \"Thats 36 keys (360 bytes) and 37 pointers (148 bytes) for a total of 508 bytes with 4 bytes wasted per node.\" The use of multi-way keys introduces the complexity of a two-phase search (multi-way search to find the correct node combined with a small sequential search to find the correct key in the node) but the advantage in doing less disk I/O more than makes up for this. \"I see no reason to do this for an in-memory structure youd be better off sticking with a balanced binary tree and keeping your code simple.\" \"Also keep in mind that the advantages of O(log N) over O(N) dont really appear when your data sets are small.\" \"If youre using a multi-way tree to store the fifteen people in your address book its probably overkill.\" \"The advantages come when youre storing something like every order from your hundred thousand customers over the last ten years.\" The whole point of big-O notation is to indicate what happens as the N approaches infinity. \"Some people may disagree but its even okay to use bubble sort if youre sure the data sets will stay below a certain size as long as nothing else is readily available :-)\" As to other uses for binary trees there are a great many such as: Binary heaps where higher keys are above or equal to lower ones rather than to the left of (or below or equal to and right); Hash trees similar to hash tables; Abstract syntax trees for compilation of computer languages; Huffman trees for compression of data; Routing trees for network traffic. \"Given how much explanation I generated for the search trees Im reticent to go into a lot of detail on the others but that should be enough to research them should you desire.\"',\n",

The reason that binary trees are used more often than n-ary trees for searching is that n-ary trees are more complex but usually provide no real speed advantage. In a (balanced) binary tree with m nodes moving from one level to the next requires one comparison and there are log_2(m) levels for a total of log_2(m) comparisons. In contrast an n-ary tree will require log_2(n) comparisons (using a binary search) to move to the next level. Since there are log_n(m) total levels the search will require log_2(n)*log_n(m) = log_2(m) comparisons total. So though n-ary trees are more complex they provide no advantage in terms of total comparisons necessary. (However n-ary trees are still useful in niche-situations. The examples that come immediately to mind are quad-trees and other space-partitioning trees where divisioning space using only two nodes per level would make the logic unnecessarily complex; and B-trees used in many databases where the limiting factor is not how many comparisons are done at each level but how many nodes can be loaded from the hard-drive at once)',\n",

Sometimes you may need to set an object to null in order to make it go out of scope (such as a static field whose value you no longer need) but overall there is usually no need to set to null. Regarding disposing objects I agree with @Andre. If the object is IDisposable it is a good idea to dispose it when you no longer need it especially if the object uses unmanaged resources. Not disposing unmanaged resources will lead to memory leaks. You can use the using statement to automatically dispose an object once your program leaves the scope of the using statement.

              "  'Objects never go out of scope in C# as they do in C++. They are dealt with by the Garbage Collector automatically when they are not used anymore. This is a more complicated approach than C++ where the scope of a variable is entirely deterministic. CLR garbage collector actively goes through all objects that have been created and works out if they are being used. An object can go \"out of scope\" in one function but if its value is returned then GC would look at whether or not the calling function holds onto the return value. Setting object references to null is unnecessary as garbage collection works by working out which objects are being referenced by other objects. \"In practice you dont have to worry about destruction it just works and its great :)\" Dispose must be called on all objects that implement IDisposable when you are finished working with them. Normally you would use a using block with those objects like so: BIGBLOCK EDIT On variable scope. Craig has asked whether the variable scope has any effect on the object lifetime. \"To properly explain that aspect of CLR Ill need to explain a few concepts from C++ and C#.\" Actual variable scope In both languages the variable can only be used in the same scope as it was defined - class function or a statement block enclosed by braces. The subtle difference however is that in C# variables cannot be redefined in a nested block. In C++ this is perfectly legal: BIGBLOCK In C# however you get a a compiler error: BIGBLOCK This makes sense if you look at generated MSIL - all the variables used by the function are defined at the start of the function. Take a look at this function: BIGBLOCK Below is the generated IL. Note that iVal2 which is defined inside the if block is actually defined at function level. Effectively this means that C# only has class and function level scope as far as variable lifetime is concerned. BIGBLOCK C++ scope and object lifetime Whenever a C++ variable allocated on the stack goes out of scope it gets destructed. Remember that in C++ you can create objects on the stack or on the heap. When you create them on the stack once execution leaves the scope they get popped off the stack and gets destroyed. BIGBLOCK When C++ objects are created on the heap they must be explicitly destroyed otherwise it is a memory leak. No such problem with stack variables though. C# Object Lifetime In CLR objects (i.e. reference types) are always created on the managed heap. This is further reinforced by object creation syntax. Consider this code snippet. BIGBLOCK In C++ this would create an instance on MyClass on the stack and call its default constructor. \"In C# it would create a reference to class MyClass that doesnt point to anything.\" The only way to create an instance of a class is by using new operator: BIGBLOCK \"In a way C# objects are a lot like objects that are created using new syntax in C++ - they are created on the heap but unlike C++ objects they are managed by the runtime so you dont have to worry about destructing them.\" Since the objects are always on the heap the fact that object references (i.e. pointers) go out of scope becomes moot. There are more factors involved in determining if an object is to be collected than simply presence of references to the object. C# Object references Jon Skeet compared object references in Java to pieces of string that are attached to the balloon which is the object. Same analogy applies to C# object references. They simply point to a location of the heap that contains the object. Thus setting it to null has no immediate effect on the object lifetime the balloon continues to exist until the GC \"pops\" it. Continuing down the balloon analogy it would seem logical that once the balloon has no strings attached to it it can be destroyed. In fact this is exactly how reference counted objects work in non-managed languages. \"Except this approach doesnt work for circular references very well.\" Imagine two balloons that are attached together by a string but neither balloon has a string to anything else. Under simple ref counting rules they both continue to exist even though the whole balloon group is \"orphaned\". .NET objects are a lot like helium balloons under a roof. When the roof opens (GC runs) - the unused balloons float away even though there might be groups of balloons that are tethered together. .NET GC uses a combination of generational GC and mark and sweep. Generational approach involves the runtime favouring to inspect objects that have been allocated most recently as they are more likely to be unused and mark and sweep involves runtime going through the whole object graph and working out if there are object groups that are unused. This adequately deals with circular dependency problem. Also .NET GC runs on another thread(so called finalizer thread) as it has quite a bit to do and doing that on the main thread would interrupt your program.',\n",
              "  '\"Normally theres no need to set fields to null.\" \"Id always recommend disposing unmanaged resources however.\" \"From experience Id also advise you to do the following:\" Unsubscribe from events if you no longer need them. \"Set any field holding a delegate or an expression to null if its no longer needed.\" \"Ive come across some very hard to find issues that were the direct result of not following the advice above.\" A good place to do this is in Dispose() but sooner is usually better. In general if a reference exists to an object the garbage collector (GC) may take a couple of generations longer to figure out that an object is no longer in use. All the while the object remains in memory. \"That may not be a problem until you find that your app is using a lot more memory than youd expect.\" When that happens hook up a memory profiler to see what objects are not being cleaned up. Setting fields referencing other objects to null and clearing collections on disposal can really help the GC figure out what objects it can remove from memory. The GC will reclaim the used memory faster making your app a lot less memory hungry and faster.',\n",

But I think there are fallacies abound in that argument. Read this for an interesting debate by respected individuals on the subject. Then read my reasoning here why I think Jeffery Richter is in the wrong camp. Now on to whether or not you should set a reference to null. The answer is no. Let me illustrate my point with the following code. BIGBLOCK So when do you think the object referenced by a is eligible for collection? If you said after the call to a = null then you are wrong. If you said after the Main method completes then you are also wrong. The correct answer is that it is eligible for collection sometime during the call to DoSomething. That is right. It is eligible before the reference is set to null and perhaps even before the call to DoSomething completes. That is because the JIT compiler can recognize when object references are no longer dereferenced even if they are still rooted.',\n",

No assumptions can be made or else it will come back to bite you. \"Dont listen to leppie.\" \"A lot of objects dont actually implement IDisposable so you dont have to worry about them.\" If they genuinely go out of scope they will be freed automatically. Also I have never come across the situation where I have had to set something to null. One thing that can happen is that a lot of objects can be held open. This can greatly increase the memory usage of your application. Sometimes it is hard to work out whether this is actually a memory leak or whether your application is just doing a lot of stuff. Memory profile tools can help with things like that but it can be tricky. In addition always unsubscribe from events that are not needed. Also be careful with WPF binding and controls. Not a usual situation but I came across a situation where I had a WPF control that was being bound to an underlying object. The underlying object was large and took up a large amount of memory. The WPF control was being replaced with a new instance and the old one was still hanging around for some reason. This caused a large memory leak.

The value of EOF is -1 because it has to be different from any return value from getchar that is an actual character. So getchar returns any character value as an unsigned char converted to int which will therefore be non-negative. \"If youre typing at the terminal and you want to provoke an end-of-file use CTRL-D (unix-style systems) or CTRL-Z (Windows).\" Then after all the input has been read getchar() will return EOF and hence getchar() != EOF will be false and the loop will terminate.

The != operator means \"not equal\". 0 stands for false and anything else stands for true. So what happens is we call the getchar() function and compare the result to -1 (EOF). If the result was not equal to EOF then the result is true because things that are not equal are not equal. If the result was equal to EOF then the result is false because things that are equal are not (not equal). The call to getchar() returns EOF when you reach the \"end of file\". \"As far as C is concerned the standard input (the data you are giving to your program by typing in the command window) is just like a file.\" Of course you can always type more so you need an explicit way to say \"I\\\\m done\". On Windows systems this is control-Z. On Unix systems this is control-D. The example in the book is not \"wrong\". It depends on what you actually want to do. Reading until EOF means that you read everything until the user says \"I\\\\m done\" and then you can\\\\t read any more. \"Reading until \\\\\\\\n means that you read a line of input.\" \"Reading until \\\\\\\\0 is a bad idea if you expect the user to type the input because it is either hard or impossible to produce this byte with a keyboard at the command prompt :)\"',\n",

You got multiple companies and each company can have multiple departments and each department can have multiple employees. Ok so now you want to do the following: List all the companies and include all their departments and all their employees. \"Note that some companies dont have any departments yet but make sure you include them as well.\" Make sure you only retrieve departments that have employees but always list all companies. So you do this: BIGBLOCK Note that the last one there is an inner join in order to fulfill the criteria that you only want departments with people. Ok so what happens now. Well the problem is it depends on the database engine the query optimizer indexes and table statistics. Let me explain. \"If the query optimizer determines that the way to do this is to first take a company then find the departments and then do an inner join with employees youre not going to get any companies that dont have departments.\" The reason for this is that the WHERE clause determines which rows end up in the final result not individual parts of the rows. \"And in this case due to the left join the Department.ID column will be NULL and thus when it comes to the INNER JOIN to Employee theres no way to fulfill that constraint for the Employee row and so it wont appear.\" On the other hand if the query optimizer decides to tackle the department-employee join first and then do a left join with the companies you will see them. So the old syntax is ambiguous. \"Theres no way to specify what you want without dealing with query hints and some databases have no way at all.\" Enter the new syntax with this you can choose. For instance if you want all companies as the problem description stated this is what you would write: BIGBLOCK Here you specify that you want the department-employee join to be done as one join and then left join the results of that with the companies. \"Additionally lets say you only want departments that contains the letter X in their name.\" \"Again with old style joins you risk losing the company as well if it doesnt have any departments with an X in its name but with the new syntax you can do this:\" BIGBLOCK This extra clause is used for the joining but is not a filter for the entire row. So the row might appear with company information but might have NULLs in all the department and employee columns for that row because there is no department with an X in its name for that company. This is hard with the old syntax. This is why amongst other vendors Microsoft has deprecated the old outer join syntax but not the old inner join syntax since SQL Server 2005 and upwards. The only way to talk to a database running on Microsoft SQL Server 2005 or 2008 using the old style outer join syntax is to set that database in 8.0 compatibility mode (aka SQL Server 2000). Additionally the old way by throwing a bunch of tables at the query optimizer with a bunch of WHERE clauses was akin to saying \"here you are do the best you can\".

Semantical Difference: FirstOrDefault returns a first item of potentially multiple (or default if none exists).

Performance Difference \"FirstOrDefault is usually faster it iterates until it finds the element and only has to iterate the whole enumerable when it doesnt find it.\" In many cases there is a high probability to find an item. SingleOrDefault needs to check if there is only one element and therefore always iterates the whole enumerable. To be precise it iterates until it finds a second element and throws an exception. But in most cases there is no second element. Conclusion \"Use FirstOrDefault if you dont care how many items there are or when you cant afford checking uniqueness (e.g.\" in a very large collection). When you check uniqueness on adding the items to the collection it might be too expensive to check it again when searching for those items. \"Use SingleOrDefault if you dont have to care about performance too much and want to make sure that the assumption of a single item is clear to the reader and checked at runtime.\" In practice you use First / FirstOrDefault often even in cases when you assume a single item to improve performance.

I cannot see anything immediately wrong with the servlet so you might want to try having a look at any filters that you have in place as well.

We are assuming that it is being thrown by the line BIGBLOCK But you might find that it is being thrown later in the code where you are trying to output to the output stream after you have tried to do the forward.

BIGBLOCK To naildown the root cause in your code just search for any line which calls a forward() sendRedirect() or sendError() without exiting the method block or skipping the remnant of the code. This can be inside the same servlet before the particular code line but also in any servlet or filter which was been called before the particular servlet. In case of sendError() if your sole purpose is to set the response status use setStatus() instead. Another probable cause is that the servlet writes to the response while a forward() will be called or has been called in the very same method. BIGBLOCK The response buffer size defaults in most server to 2KB so if you write more than 2KB to it then it will be committed and forward() will fail the same way: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot forward after response has been committed \"Solution is obvious just dont write to the response in the servlet.\" \"Thats the responsibility of the JSP.\" You just set a request attribute like so request.setAttribute(\"data\" \"some string\") and then print it in JSP like so ${data}.

The modulus you are currently using is 64 which allows 12 ie. 19% of remainders as possible squares. With a little coding I found the modulus 110880 which allows only 2016 ie. 1.8% of remainders as possible squares.

It can be easily seen that in Python classes need to be first-class objects too to enable this behavior. \"Ive never written one myself but I think one of the nicest uses of metaclasses can be seen in the Django framework.\" The model classes use a metaclass approach to enable a declarative style of writing new models or form classes.

Almost all low-level graphics routines use bitshifting. For example way back in the olden days we used mode 13h (320x200 256 colors) for games. In Mode 13h the video memory was laid out sequentially per pixel. That meant to calculate the location for a pixel you would use the following math: Now back in that day and age speed was critical so we would use bitshifts to do this operation. However 320 is not a power of two so to get around this we have to find out what is a power of two that added together makes 320: Now we can convert that into left shifts: For a final result of: \"Now we get the same offset as before except instead of an expensive multiplication operation we use the two bitshifts...in x86 it would be something like this (note its been forever since Ive done assembly (editors note: corrected a couple mistakes and added a 32-bit example)):\" Total: 28 cycles on whatever ancient CPU had these timings. Vrs 12 cycles on the same ancient CPU. Yes we would work this hard to shave off 16 CPU cycles. In 32 or 64-bit mode both versions get a lot shorter and faster. Modern out-of-order execution CPUs like Intel Skylake (see http://agner.org/optimize/) have very fast hardware multiply (low latency and high throughput) so the gain is much smaller. AMD Bulldozer-family is a bit slower especially for 64-bit multiply. On Intel CPUs and AMD Ryzen two shifts are slightly lower latency but more instructions than a multiply (which may lead to lower throughput): vs. Compilers will do this for you: See how gcc clang and MSVC all use shift+lea when optimizing . The most interesting thing to note here is that x86 has a shift-and-add instruction () that can do small left shifts and add at the same time with the performance as and  instruction. ARM is even more powerful: one operand of any instruction can be left or right shifted for free. \"So scaling by a compile-time-constant thats known to be a power-of-2 can be even more efficient than a multiply.\" OK back in the modern days... something more useful now would be to use bitshifting to store two 8-bit values in a 16-bit integer.

They shift bits. \"Heres a brief (or not-so-brief) introduction to the different shift operators.\" The Operators <li> is the  arithmetic (or signed) right shift operator. <li> is the logical (or unsigned) right shift operator. <li> is the left shift operator and meets the needs of both logical and arithmetic shifts. All of these operators can be applied to integer values (  possibly  and  or ). In some languages applying the shift operators to any datatype smaller than  automatically resizes the operand to be an . Note that  is not an operator because it would be redundant. Also note that C and C++ do not distinguish between the right shift operators. They provide only the  operator and the right-shifting behavior is implementation defined for signed types. Left shift (&lt;&lt;) Integers are stored in memory as a series of bits. For example the number 6 stored as a 32-bit  would be: Shifting this bit pattern to the left one position () would result in the number 12: As you can see the digits have shifted to the left by one position and the last digit on the right is filled with a zero. You might also note that shifting left is equivalent to multiplication by powers of 2. So  is equivalent to  and  is equivalent to . A good optimizing compiler will replace multiplications with shifts when possible. Non-circular shifting Please note that these are <em>not</em> circular shifts. Shifting this value to the left by one position (): results in 3221225472: The digit that gets shifted \"off the end\" is lost. It does not wrap around. Logical right shift (>>>) A logical right shift is the converse to the left shift. Rather than moving bits to the left they simply move to the right. For example shifting the number 12: to the right by one position () will get back our original 6: So we see that shifting to the right is equivalent to division by powers of 2. Lost bits are gone However a shift cannot reclaim \"lost\" bits. For example if we shift this pattern: to the left 4 positions () we get 2147483744: and then shifting back () we get 134217734: We cannot get back our original value once we have lost bits. Arithmetic right shift (>>) The arithmetic right shift is exactly like the logical right shift except instead of padding with zero it pads with the most significant bit. This is because the most significant bit is the <em>sign</em> bit or the bit that distinguishes positive and negative numbers. By padding with the most significant bit the arithmetic right shift is sign-preserving. For example if we interpret this bit pattern as a negative number: we have the number -2147483552. Shifting this to the right 4 positions with the arithmetic shift (-2147483552 >> 4) would give us: or the number -134217722. So we see that we have preserved the sign of our negative numbers by using the arithmetic right shift rather than the logical right shift. And once again we see that we are performing division by powers of 2.',\n",

Inside the $derek instance we can refer to those as $this->first_name and $this->last_name ClassName:: is used to refer to that type of class and its static variables static methods. If it helps you can mentally replace the word \"static\" with \"shared\". Because they are shared they cannot refer to $this which refers to a specific instance (not shared). Static Variables (i.e. static $db_connection) can be shared among all instances of a type of object. For example all database objects share a single connection (static $connection). <strong>Static Variables Example:</strong>Pretend we have a database class with a single member variable: static $num_connections;Now put this in the constructor: Just as objects have constructors they also have destructors which are executed when the object dies or is unset: Every time we create a new instance it will increase our connection counter by one. Every time we destroy or stop using an instance it will decrease the connection counter by one. In this way we can monitor the number of instances of the database object we have in use with: Because $num_connections is static (shared) it will reflect the total number of active database objects. You may have seen this technique used to share database connections among all instances of a database class. \"This is done because creating the database connection takes a long time so its best to create just one and share it (this is called a Singleton Pattern).\" Static Methods (i.e. public static View::format_phone_number($digits)) can be used WITHOUT first instantiating one of those objects (i.e. They do not internally refer to $this). <strong>Static Method Example:</strong> As you can see public static function prettyName knows nothing about the object. \"Its just working with the parameters you pass in like a normal function thats not part of an object.\" Why bother then if we could just have it not as part of the object? <li>First attaching functions to objects helps you keep things organized so you know where to find them. <li>Second it prevents naming conflicts. \"In a big project youre likely to have two developers create getName() functions.\" \"If one creates a ClassName1::getName() and the other creates ClassName2::getName() its no problem at all.\" No conflict. Yay static methods! \"<strong>SELF::</strong>If you are coding <em>outside</em> the object that has the static method you want to refer to you must call it using the objects name View::format_phone_number($phone_number);If you are coding <em>inside</em> the object that has the static method you want to refer to you can <em>either</em> use the objects name View::format_phone_number($pn) OR you can use the self::format_phone_number($pn)  shortcut\" The same goes for static variables:<strong>Example:</strong> View::templates_path versus self::templates_path \"Inside the DB class if we were referring to a static method of some other object we would use the objects name:<strong>Example:</strong> Session::getUsersOnline();\" But if the DB class wanted to refer to its own static variable it would just say self:<strong>Example:</strong> self::connection; Hope that helps clear things up :)',\n",

Normally in Python you want your code to support inheritance of course (since inheritance is so handy it would be bad to stop code using yours from using it! ) so  is less bad than checking identity of s because it seamlessly supports inheritance. \"Its not that  is <em>good</em> mind you—its just <em>less bad</em> than checking equality of types.\" The normal Pythonic preferred solution is almost invariably \"duck typing\": try using the argument <em>as if</em> it was of a certain desired type do it in a / statement catching all exceptions that could arise if the argument was not in fact of that type (or any other type nicely duck-mimicking it;-) and in the  clause try something else (using the argument \"as if\" it was of some other type).  <strong>is</strong> however quite a special case—a builtin type that exists <strong>only</strong> to let you use  (both  and  subclass ). Strings are sequences (you could loop over them index them slice them ...) but you generally want to treat them as \"scalar\" types—it\\\\s somewhat incovenient (but a reasonably frequent use case) to treat all kinds of strings (and maybe other scalar types i.e. ones you can\\\\t loop on) one way all containers (lists sets dicts ...) in another way and  plus  helps you do that—the overall structure of this idiom is something like: You could say that  is an <em>Abstract Base Class</em> (\"ABC\")—it offers no concrete functionality to subclasses but rather exists as a \"marker\" mainly for use with . The concept is obviously a growing one in Python since PEP 3119 which introduces a generalization of it was accepted and has been implemented starting with Python 2.6 and 3.0. The PEP makes it clear that while ABCs can often substitute for duck typing there is generally no big pressure to do that (see here). ABCs as implemented in recent Python versions do however offer extra goodies:  (and ) can now mean more than just \"[an instance of] a derived class\" (in particular any class can be \"registered\" with an ABC so that it will show as a subclass and its instances as instances of the ABC); and ABCs can also offer extra convenience to actual subclasses in a very natural way via Template Method design pattern applications (see here and here [[part II]] for more on the TM DP in general and specifically in Python independent of ABCs). For the underlying mechanics of ABC support as offered in Python 2.6 see here; for their 3.1 version very similar see here. \"In both versions standard library module collections (thats the 3.1 version—for the very similar 2.6 version see here) offers several useful ABCs.\" For the purpose of this answer the key thing to retain about ABCs (beyond an arguably more natural placement for TM DP functionality compared to the classic Python alternative of mixin classes such as UserDict.DictMixin) is that they make  (and ) much more attractive and pervasive (in Python 2.6 and going forward) than they used to be (in 2.5 and before) and therefore by contrast make checking type equality an even worse practice in recent Python versions than it already used to be.',\n",

In many languages methods are represented by functions and subroutines. The main distinction that most languages use for these is that functions may return a value back to the caller and a subroutine may not. However many modern languages only have functions but these can optionally not return any value. For example lets say you want to describe a cat and you would like that to be able to yawn. You would create a Cat class with a Yawn method which would most likely be a function without any return value.',\n",

Being \"owned\" by a object/class means that you refer to the method through the object/class; for example in Java if you want to invoke a method \"open()\" owned by an object \"door\" you need to write \"door.open()\". Usually methods also gain some extra attributes describing their behaviour within the object/class for example: visibility (related to the object oriented concept of encapsulation) which defines from which objects (or classes) the method can be invoked. In many object oriented languages all \"functions\" belong to some object (or class) and so in these languages there are no functions that are not methods.',\n",

It is thus <em>just</em> a \"function.\" Javascript is technically Object Oriented as well but faces many limitations compared to a full-blown language like C++ C# or Pascal. Nonetheless the distinction should still hold. A couple of additional facts: C# is fully object oriented so you cannot create standalone \"functions.\" In C# every function is bound to an object and is thus technically a \"method.\" The kicker is that few people in C# refer to them as \"methods\" - they just use the term \"functions\" because there isn\\\\t any real distinction to be made.

One reason for this is that GET may be used arbitrarily by robots or crawlers which should not need to consider the side effects that a request should cause. and POST submits data to be processed (e.g. from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new resource or the updates of existing resources or both.

HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616) section 9 Method Definitions contains more information on  and  as well as the other HTTP methods if you are interested. In addition to explaining the intended uses of each method the spec also provides at least one practical reason for why  should only be used to retrieve data: Authors of services which use the HTTP protocol SHOULD NOT use GET based forms for the submission of sensitive data because this will cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI. Many existing servers proxies and user agents will log the request URI in some place where it might be visible to third parties. Servers can use POST-based form submission instead Finally an important consideration when using  for AJAX requests is that some browsers - IE in particular - will cache the results of a  request.

As for light-weight branches then Mercurial has supported repositories with <em>multiple branches</em> since... always I think. Git repositories with multiple branches are exactly that: multiple diverged strands of development in a single repository.

In my experience this is actually typical of discussions in non-academic settings. Apologies for any confusion caused. Big O complexity can be visualized with this graph: The simplest definition I can give for Big-O notation is this: <strong>Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm.</strong> There are some important and deliberately chosen words in that sentence: <li><strong>relative:</strong> you can only compare apples to apples. \"You cant compare an algorithm to do arithmetic multiplication to an algorithm that sorts a list of integers.\" But a comparison of two algorithms to do arithmetic operations (one multiplication one addition) will tell you something meaningful; <li><strong>representation:</strong> Big-O (in its simplest form) reduces the comparison between algorithms to a single variable. That variable is chosen based on observations or assumptions. For example sorting algorithms are typically compared based on comparison operations (comparing two nodes to determine their relative ordering). This assumes that comparison is expensive. But what if comparison is cheap but swapping is expensive? It changes the comparison; and <li><strong>complexity:</strong> if it takes me one second to sort 10000 elements how long will it take me to sort one million? Complexity in this instance is a relative measure to something else. \"Come back and reread the above when youve read the rest.\" The best example of Big-O I can think of is doing arithmetic. Take two numbers (123456 and 789012). The basic arithmetic operations we learnt in school were: <li>addition; <li>subtraction; <li>multiplication; and <li>division. Each of these is an operation or a problem. A method of solving these is called an <strong>algorithm</strong>. Addition is the simplest. You line the numbers up (to the right) and add the digits in a column writing the last number of that addition in the result. \"The tens part of that number is carried over to the next column.\" \"Lets assume that the addition of these numbers is the most expensive operation in this algorithm.\" It stands to reason that to add these two numbers together we have to add together 6 digits (and possibly carry a 7th). If we add two 100 digit numbers together we have to do 100 additions. If we add <strong>two</strong> 10000 digit numbers we have to do 10000 additions. See the pattern? The <strong>complexity</strong> (being the number of operations) is directly proportional to the number of digits <em>n</em> in the larger number. We call this <strong>O(n)</strong> or <strong>linear complexity</strong>. Subtraction is similar (except you may need to borrow instead of carry). Multiplication is different. You line the numbers up take the first digit in the bottom number and multiply it in turn against each digit in the top number and so on through each digit. So to multiply our two 6 digit numbers we must do 36 multiplications. We may need to do as many as 10 or 11 column adds to get the end result too. If we have two 100-digit numbers we need to do 10000 multiplications and 200 adds. For two one million digit numbers we need to do one trillion (1012) multiplications and two million adds. As the algorithm scales with n-<em>squared</em> this is <strong>O(n2)</strong> or <strong>quadratic complexity</strong>. This is a good time to introduce another important concept: <strong>We only care about the most significant portion of complexity.</strong> The astute may have realized that we could express the number of operations as: n2 + 2n. But as you saw from our example with two numbers of a million digits apiece the second term (2n) becomes insignificant (accounting for 0.0002% of the total operations by that stage). \"One can notice that weve assumed the worst case scenario here.\" While multiplying 6 digit numbers if one of them is 4 digit and the other one is 6 digit then we only have 24 multiplications. \"Still we calculate the worst case scenario for that n i.e when both are 6 digit numbers.\" Hence Big-O notation is about the Worst-case scenario of an algorithm The Telephone Book \"The next best example I can think of is the telephone book normally called the White Pages or similar but itll vary from country to country.\" \"But Im talking about the one that lists people by surname and then initials or first name possibly address and then telephone numbers.\" Now if you were instructing a computer to look up the phone number for \"John Smith\" in a telephone book that contains 1000000 names what would you do? \"Ignoring the fact that you could guess how far in the Ss started (lets assume you cant) what would you do?\" A typical implementation might be to open up to the middle take the 500000th and compare it to \"Smith\". If it happens to be \"Smith John\" we just got real lucky. Far more likely is that \"John Smith\" will be before or after that name. \"If its after we then divide the last half of the phone book in half and repeat.\" \"If its before then we divide the first half of the phone book in half and repeat.\" And so on. This is called a <strong>binary search</strong> and is used every day in programming whether you realize it or not. So if you want to find a name in a phone book of a million names you can actually find any name by doing this at most 20 times. \"In comparing search algorithms we decide that this comparison is our n.\" <li>For a phone book of 3 names it takes 2 comparisons (at most). <li>For 7 it takes at most 3. <li>For 15 it takes 4. <li>… <li>For 1000000 it takes 20. \"That is staggeringly good isnt it?\" In Big-O terms this is <strong>O(log n)</strong> or <strong>logarithmic complexity</strong>. Now the logarithm in question could be ln (base e) log10 log2 or some other base. \"It doesnt matter its still O(log n) just like O(2n2) and O(100n2) are still both O(n2).\" \"Its worthwhile at this point to explain that Big O can be used to determine three cases with an algorithm:\" <li><strong>Best Case:</strong> In the telephone book search the best case is that we find the name in one comparison. This is <strong>O(1)</strong> or <strong>constant complexity</strong>; <li><strong>Expected Case:</strong> As discussed above this is O(log n); and <li><strong>Worst Case:</strong> This is also O(log n). \"Normally we dont care about the best case.\" \"Were interested in the expected and worst case.\" Sometimes one or the other of these will be more important. Back to the telephone book. What if you have a phone number and want to find a name? The police have a reverse phone book but such look-ups are denied to the general public. Or are they? Technically you can reverse look-up a number in an ordinary phone book. How? You start at the first name and compare the number. \"If its a match great if not you move on to the next.\" You have to do it this way because the phone book is <strong>unordered</strong> (by phone number anyway). So to find a name given the phone number (reverse lookup): <li><strong>Best Case:</strong> O(1); <li><strong>Expected Case:</strong> O(n) (for 500000); and <li><strong>Worst Case:</strong> O(n) (for 1000000). The Travelling Salesman This is quite a famous problem in computer science and deserves a mention. In this problem you have N towns. Each of those towns is linked to 1 or more other towns by a road of a certain distance. The Travelling Salesman problem is to find the shortest tour that visits every town. Sounds simple? Think again. If you have 3 towns A B and C with roads between all pairs then you could go: <li>A → B → C <li>A → C → B <li>B → C → A <li>B → A → C <li>C → A → B <li>C → B → A \"Well actually theres less than that because some of these are equivalent (A → B → C and C → B → A are equivalent for example because they use the same roads just in reverse).\" In actuality there are 3 possibilities. <li>Take this to 4 towns and you have (iirc) 12 possibilities. \"<li>With 5 its 60.\" <li>6 becomes 360. This is a function of a mathematical operation called a <strong>factorial</strong>. Basically: <li>5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 <li>6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720 <li>7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040 <li>… <li>25! = 25 × 24 × … × 2 × 1 = 15511210043330985984000000 <li>… <li>50! = 50 × 49 × … × 2 × 1 = 3.04140932 × 1064 So the Big-O of the Travelling Salesman problem is <strong>O(n! )</strong> or <strong>factorial or combinatorial complexity</strong>. \"<strong>By the time you get to 200 towns there isnt enough time left in the universe to solve the problem with traditional computers.</strong>\" Something to think about. Polynomial Time Another point I wanted to make quick mention of is that any algorithm that has a complexity of <strong>O(na)</strong> is said to have <strong>polynomial complexity</strong> or is solvable in <strong>polynomial time</strong>. O(n) O(n2) etc are all polynomial time. Some problems cannot be solved in polynomial time. Certain things are used in the world because of this. Public Key Cryptography is a prime example. It is computationally hard to find two prime factors of a very large number. \"If it wasnt we couldnt use the public key systems we use.\" \"Anyway thats it for my (hopefully plain English) explanation of Big O (revised).\"',\n",

              "  '<strong>Big O describes the fundamental scaling nature of an algorithm.</strong> There is a lot of information that Big O does not tell you about a given algorithm. It cuts to the bone and gives only information about the scaling nature of an algorithm specifically how the resource use (think time or memory) of an algorithm scales in response to the \"input size\". Consider the difference between a steam engine and a rocket. They are not merely different varieties of the same thing (as say a Prius engine vs. a Lamborghini engine) but they are dramatically different kinds of propulsion systems at their core. A steam engine may be faster than a toy rocket but no steam piston engine will be able to achieve the speeds of an orbital launch vehicle. This is because these systems have different scaling characteristics with regards to the relation of fuel required (\"resource usage\") to reach a given speed (\"input size\"). Why is this so important? Because software deals with problems that may differ in size by factors up to a trillion. Consider that for a moment. The ratio between the speed necessary to travel to the Moon and human walking speed is less than 10000:1 and that is absolutely tiny compared to the range in input sizes software may face. \"And because software may face an astronomical range in input sizes there is the potential for the Big O complexity of an algorithm its fundamental scaling nature to trump any implementation details.\" Consider the canonical sorting example. Bubble-sort is O(n2) while merge-sort is O(n log n). \"Lets say you have two sorting applications application A which uses bubble-sort and application B which uses merge-sort and lets say that for input sizes of around 30 elements application A is 1000x faster than application B at sorting.\" \"If you never have to sort much more than 30 elements then its obvious that you should prefer application A as it is much faster at these input sizes.\" \"However if you find that you may have to sort ten million items then what youd expect is that application B actually ends up being thousands of times faster than application A in this case entirely due to the way each algorithm scales.\"',\n",

When we say some algorithm is O(f(n)) we are saying that the running time (or space required) by that algorithm is always lower than some constant times f(n). To say that binary search has a running time of O(logn) is to say that there exists some constant c which you can multiply log(n) by that will always be larger than the running time of binary search. In this case you will always have some constant factor of log(n) comparisons. In other words where g(n) is the running time of your algorithm we say that g(n) = O(f(n)) when g(n) &lt;= c*f(n) when n > k where c and k are some constants.',\n",

If the select statement used by the view joins many tables or uses joins based on non-indexed columns the view could perform poorly. Materialized views are similar to regular views in that they are a logical view of your data (based on a select statement) however the underlying query resultset has been saved to a table. The upside of this is that when you query a materialized view you are querying a table which may also be indexed. In addition because all the joins have been resolved at materialized view refresh time you pay the price of the join once (or as often as you refresh your materialized view) rather than each time you select from the materialized view. In addition with query rewrite enabled Oracle can optimize a query that selects from the source of your materialized view in such a way that it instead reads from your materialized view. In situations where you create materialized views as forms of aggregate tables or as copies of frequently executed queries this can greatly speed up the response time of your end user application. The downside though is that the data you get back from the materialized view is only as up to date as the last time the materialized view has been refreshed. Materialized views can be set to refresh manually on a set schedule or based on the database detecting a change in data from one of the underlying tables. Materialized views can be incrementally updated by combining them with materialized view logs which act as change data capture sources on the underlying tables.

Additionally App Server have components and features to support Application level services such as Connection Pooling Object Pooling Transaction Support Messaging services etc. <li>As web servers are well suited for static content and app servers for dynamic content most of the production environments have web server acting as reverse proxy to app server. That means while servicing a page request static contents (such as images/Static HTML) are served by web server that interprets the request. Using some kind of filtering technique (mostly extension of requested resource) web server identifies dynamic content request and transparently forwards to app server Example of such configuration is Apache Tomcat HTTP Server and Oracle (formerly BEA) WebLogic Server.

Some history. In early days of the Mosaic browser and hyperlinked content there evolved this thing called a \"web server\" that served web page content and images over HTTP. Most of the content was static and the HTTP 1.0 protocol was just a way to ship files around. Quickly the \"web server\" category evolved to include CGI capability - effectively launching a process on each web request to generate dynamic content. HTTP also matured and the products became more sophisticated with caching security and management features. As the technology matured we got company-specific Java-based server-side technology from Kiva and NetDynamics which eventually all merged into JSP. Microsoft added ASP I think in 1996 to Windows NT 4.0. The static web server had learned some new tricks so that it was an effective \"app server\" for many scenarios. In a parallel category the app server had evolved and existed for a long time. companies delivered products for Unix like Tuxedo TopEnd Encina that were philosophically derived from Mainframe application management and monitoring environments like IMS and CICS. \"Microsofts offering was Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) which later evolved into COM+.\" Most of these products specified \"closed\" product-specific communications protocols to interconnect \"fat\" clients to servers. (For Encina the comms protocol was DCE RPC; for MTS it was DCOM; etc.) In 1995/96 these traditional app server products began to embed basic HTTP communication capability at first via gateways. And the lines began to blur. Web servers got more and more mature with respect to handling higher loads more concurrency and better features. App servers delivered more and more HTTP-based communication capability. At this point the line between \"app server\" and \"web server\" is a fuzzy one. But people continue to use the terms differently as a matter of emphasis. When someone says \"web server\" you often think HTTP-centric web UI oriented apps. When someone says \"App server\" you may think \"heavier loads enterprise features transactions and queuing multi-channel communication (HTTP + more). But often it is the same product that serves both sets of workload requirements. <li>WebSphere IBM\\\\s \"app server\" has its own bundled web server. <li>WebLogic another traditional app server likewise. \"<li>Windows which is Microsofts App Server (in addition to being its File&amp;Print Server Media Server etc.\" ) bundles IIS.',\n",

This strategy is most applicable to high-volume systems and three-tier architectures where you do not necessarily maintain a connection to the database for your session. In this situation the client cannot actually maintain database locks as the connections are taken from a pool and you may not be using the same connection from one access to the next. Pessimistic Locking is when you lock the record for your exclusive use until you have finished with it. It has much better integrity than optimistic locking but requires you to be careful with your application design to avoid Deadlocks. To use pessimistic locking you need either a direct connection to the database (as would typically be the case in a two tier client server application) or an externally available transaction ID that can be used independently of the connection. In the latter case you open the transaction with the TxID and then reconnect using that ID. The DBMS maintains the locks and allows you to pick the session back up through the TxID. This is how distributed transactions using two-phase commit protocols (such as XA or COM+ Transactions) work.',\n",

It wrote the data out in sorted form: BIGBLOCK so that when reading it back in ended up with the following tree: BIGBLOCK which is the degenerate form. \"If you go looking for Frank in that tree youll have to search all six nodes before you find him.\" Binary trees become truly useful when you balance them. This involves rotating sub-trees through their root node so that the height difference between any two sub-trees is less than or equal to 1. Adding those names above one at a time into a balanced tree would give you the following sequence: BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK &nbsp; BIGBLOCK You can actually see whole sub-trees rotating to the left as the entries are added and this gives you a balanced binary tree in which the worst case lookup is O(log N) rather than O(N) as the degenerate form gives. At no point does the highest NULL () differ from the lowest by more than one level. And in the final tree above you can find Frank by only looking at three nodes (  and finally ). Of course they become even more useful when you make them balanced <em>multi-way</em> trees rather than binary tress.

For example if the pointers are 4 bytes and the key size is 10 the number of keys in a 512-byte node is 36. \"Thats 36 keys (360 bytes) and 37 pointers (148 bytes) for a total of 508 bytes with 4 bytes wasted per node.\" The use of multi-way keys introduces the complexity of a two-phase search (multi-way search to find the correct node combined with a small sequential search to find the correct key in the node) but the advantage in doing less disk I/O more than makes up for this. \"I see no reason to do this for an in-memory structure youd be better off sticking with a balanced binary tree and keeping your code simple.\" \"Also keep in mind that the advantages of O(log N) over O(N) dont really appear when your data sets are small.\" \"If youre using a multi-way tree to store the fifteen people in your address book its probably overkill.\" \"The advantages come when youre storing something like every order from your hundred thousand customers over the last ten years.\" The whole point of big-O notation is to indicate what happens as the N approaches infinity. \"Some people may disagree but its even okay to use bubble sort if youre sure the data sets will stay below a certain size as long as nothing else is readily available :-)\" As to other uses for binary trees there are a great many such as: <li>Binary heaps where higher keys are <em>above or equal to</em> lower ones rather than to the left of (or below or equal to and right); <li>Hash trees similar to hash tables; <li>Abstract syntax trees for compilation of computer languages; <li>Huffman trees for compression of data; <li>Routing trees for network traffic. \"Given how much explanation I generated for the search trees Im reticent to go into a lot of detail on the others but that should be enough to research them should you desire.\"',\n",

This is a more complicated approach than C++ where the scope of a variable is entirely deterministic. CLR garbage collector actively goes through all objects that have been created and works out if they are being used. An object can go \"out of scope\" in one function but if its value is returned then GC would look at whether or not the calling function holds onto the return value. Setting object references to  is unnecessary as garbage collection works by working out which objects are being referenced by other objects. \"In practice you dont have to worry about destruction it just works and its great :)\"  must be called on all objects that implement  when you are finished working with them. Normally you would use a  block with those objects like so: BIGBLOCK <strong>EDIT</strong> On variable scope. Craig has asked whether the variable scope has any effect on the object lifetime. \"To properly explain that aspect of CLR Ill need to explain a few concepts from C++ and C#.\" Actual variable scope In both languages the variable can only be used in the same scope as it was defined - class function or a statement block enclosed by braces. The subtle difference however is that in C# variables cannot be redefined in a nested block. In C++ this is perfectly legal: BIGBLOCK In C# however you get a a compiler error: BIGBLOCK This makes sense if you look at generated MSIL - all the variables used by the function are defined at the start of the function. Take a look at this function: BIGBLOCK Below is the generated IL. Note that iVal2 which is defined inside the if block is actually defined at function level. Effectively this means that C# only has class and function level scope as far as variable lifetime is concerned. BIGBLOCK C++ scope and object lifetime Whenever a C++ variable allocated on the stack goes out of scope it gets destructed. Remember that in C++ you can create objects on the stack or on the heap. When you create them on the stack once execution leaves the scope they get popped off the stack and gets destroyed. BIGBLOCK When C++ objects are created on the heap they must be explicitly destroyed otherwise it is a memory leak. No such problem with stack variables though. C# Object Lifetime In CLR objects (i.e. reference types) are <strong>always</strong> created on the managed heap. This is further reinforced by object creation syntax. Consider this code snippet. BIGBLOCK In C++ this would create an instance on  on the stack and call its default constructor. \"In C# it would create a reference to class  that doesnt point to anything.\" The only way to create an instance of a class is by using  operator: BIGBLOCK \"In a way C# objects are a lot like objects that are created using  syntax in C++ - they are created on the heap but unlike C++ objects they are managed by the runtime so you dont have to worry about destructing them.\" Since the objects are <strong>always</strong> on the heap the fact that object references (i.e. pointers) go out of scope becomes moot. There are more factors involved in determining if an object is to be collected than simply presence of references to the object. C# Object references Jon Skeet compared object references in Java to pieces of string that are attached to the balloon which is the object. Same analogy applies to C# object references. They simply point to a location of the heap that contains the object. Thus setting it to null has no immediate effect on the object lifetime the balloon continues to exist until the GC \"pops\" it. Continuing down the balloon analogy it would seem logical that once the balloon has no strings attached to it it can be destroyed. In fact this is exactly how reference counted objects work in non-managed languages. \"Except this approach doesnt work for circular references very well.\" Imagine two balloons that are attached together by a string but neither balloon has a string to anything else. Under simple ref counting rules they both continue to exist even though the whole balloon group is \"orphaned\". .NET objects are a lot like helium balloons under a roof. When the roof opens (GC runs) - the unused balloons float away even though there might be groups of balloons that are tethered together. .NET GC uses a combination of generational GC and mark and sweep. Generational approach involves the runtime favouring to inspect objects that have been allocated most recently as they are more likely to be unused and mark and sweep involves runtime going through the whole object graph and working out if there are object groups that are unused. This adequately deals with circular dependency problem. Also .NET GC runs on another thread(so called finalizer thread) as it has quite a bit to do and doing that on the main thread would interrupt your program.',\n",
              "  '\"Normally theres no need to set fields to null.\" \"Id always recommend disposing unmanaged resources however.\" \"From experience Id also advise you to do the following:\" <li>Unsubscribe from events if you no longer need them. \"<li>Set any field holding a delegate or an expression to null if its no longer needed.\" \"Ive come across some very hard to find issues that were the direct result of not following the advice above.\" A good place to do this is in Dispose() but sooner is usually better. In general if a reference exists to an object the garbage collector (GC) may take a couple of generations longer to figure out that an object is no longer in use. All the while the object remains in memory. \"That may not be a problem until you find that your app is using a lot more memory than youd expect.\" When that happens hook up a memory profiler to see what objects are not being cleaned up. Setting fields referencing other objects to null and clearing collections on disposal can really help the GC figure out what objects it can remove from memory. The GC will reclaim the used memory faster making your app a lot less memory hungry and faster.',\n",

The correct answer is that it is eligible for collection sometime <strong>during</strong> the call to . That is right.

DBMSs know how to optimise this SQL so that the performance difference to writing this using JOINs is negligible (if any). Using the JOIN notation makes the SQL statement <em>more</em> readable (IMHO not using joins turns the statement into a mess). \"Using the cross product you need to provide join criteria in the WHERE clause and thats the problem with the notation.\" You are crowding your WHERE clause with stuff like BIGBLOCK which is only used to restrict the cross product.

Also if all the joins are INNER then both versions are equivalent. \"However the moment you have an OUTER join anywhere in the statement things get much more complicated and its virtually guarantee that what you write wont be querying what you think you wrote.\"',\n",
              "  'The old syntax with just listing the tables and using the  clause to specify the join criteria is being deprecated in most modern databases. \"Its not just for show the old syntax has the possibility of being ambiguous when you use both INNER and OUTER joins in the same query.\" Let me give you an example. \"Lets suppose you have 3 tables in your system:\" BIGBLOCK Each table contain numerous rows linked together. You got multiple companies and each company can have multiple departments and each department can have multiple employees. Ok so now you want to do the following: List all the companies and include all their departments and all their employees. \"Note that some companies dont have any departments yet but make sure you include them as well.\" Make sure you only retrieve departments that have employees but always list all companies. So you do this: BIGBLOCK Note that the last one there is an inner join in order to fulfill the criteria that you only want departments with people. Ok so what happens now. Well the problem is it depends on the database engine the query optimizer indexes and table statistics. Let me explain. \"If the query optimizer determines that the way to do this is to first take a company then find the departments and then do an inner join with employees youre not going to get any companies that dont have departments.\" The reason for this is that the  clause determines which <em>rows</em> end up in the final result not individual parts of the rows. \"And in this case due to the left join the Department.ID column will be NULL and thus when it comes to the INNER JOIN to Employee theres no way to fulfill that constraint for the Employee row and so it wont appear.\" On the other hand if the query optimizer decides to tackle the department-employee join first and then do a left join with the companies you will see them. So the old syntax is ambiguous. \"Theres no way to specify what you want without dealing with query hints and some databases have no way at all.\" Enter the new syntax with this you can choose. For instance if you want all companies as the problem description stated this is what you would write: BIGBLOCK Here you specify that you want the department-employee join to be done as one join and then left join the results of that with the companies. \"Additionally lets say you only want departments that contains the letter X in their name.\" \"Again with old style joins you risk losing the company as well if it doesnt have any departments with an X in its name but with the new syntax you can do this:\" BIGBLOCK This extra clause is used for the joining but is not a filter for the entire row. So the row might appear with company information but might have NULLs in all the department and employee columns for that row because there is no department with an X in its name for that company. This is hard with the old syntax. This is why amongst other vendors Microsoft has deprecated the old outer join syntax but not the old inner join syntax since SQL Server 2005 and upwards. The only way to talk to a database running on Microsoft SQL Server 2005 or 2008 using the old style outer join syntax is to set that database in 8.0 compatibility mode (aka SQL Server 2000). Additionally the old way by throwing a bunch of tables at the query optimizer with a bunch of WHERE clauses was akin to saying \"here you are do the best you can\". With the new syntax the query optimizer has less work to do in order to figure out what parts goes together. So there you have it. LEFT and INNER JOIN is the wave of the future.',\n",

At the end r and t/2-r will be square roots of x modulo t/2. (Note that if r is a square root of x then so is -r.  This is true even modulo numbers but beware modulo some numbers things can have even more than 2 square roots; notably this includes powers of 2.)

              "'A metaclass is the class of a class. Like a class defines how an instance of the class behaves a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass. While in Python you can use arbitrary callables for metaclasses (like Jerub shows) the more useful approach is actually to make it an actual class itself. type is the usual metaclass in Python. \"In case youre wondering yes type is itself a class and it is its own type.\" \"You wont be able to recreate something like type purely in Python but Python cheats a little.\" To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass type. A metaclass is most commonly used as a class-factory. \"Like you create an instance of the class by calling the class Python creates a new class (when it executes the class statement) by calling the metaclass.\" \"Combined with the normal __init__ and __new__ methods metaclasses therefore allow you to do extra things when creating a class like registering the new class with some registry or even replace the class with something else entirely.\" When the class statement is executed Python first executes the body of the class statement as a normal block of code. The resulting namespace (a dict) holds the attributes of the class-to-be. The metaclass is determined by looking at the baseclasses of the class-to-be (metaclasses are inherited) at the __metaclass__ attribute of the class-to-be (if any) or the __metaclass__ global variable. The metaclass is then called with the name bases and attributes of the class to instantiate it. However metaclasses actually define the type of a class not just a factory for it so you can do much more with them. You can for instance define normal methods on the metaclass. These metaclass-methods are like classmethods in that they can be called on the class without an instance but they are also not like classmethods in that they cannot be called on an instance of the class. type.__subclasses__() is an example of a method on the type metaclass. \"You can also define the normal magic methods like __add__ __iter__ and __getattr__ to implement or change how the class behaves.\" \"Heres an aggregated example of the bits and pieces:\"'"
